  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’m a WordPress developer.</p>

<p>This is a basic Jekyll blog, but it’s not my main blog (or series of blogs).</p>

<p><strong><em>So what gives???</em></strong></p>

<p>Well, I work on projects daily that do not involve me committing anything, pushing code, or showing any evidence that I “checked in” for the day.</p>

<p>GitHub offers free web pages for Users and Projects.</p>

<p>So, I thought I’d take advatage of this to serve <strong>3 main purposes</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Showing up</strong>.This blog exists to show a history of me “showing up and doing the work”. As an independent freelancer, I don’t have anyone looking over my shoulder and making sure I’m on task and working for the day, that I did <em>something</em>, <strong><em>anything</em></strong> today.</li>
  <li><strong>Accountability</strong>. GitHub has the “Contributions Calendar”, which shows if you were actively pushing code on any given day. I do like to take weekends “off”, or at least not work as hard:-). However, having a visual representation of my working time and trying not to “break the chain” is essential for my personal encouragement and continued progress as a developer.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation</strong>. Getting in the habit of documenting the work I do is essential not only for me, but for colaborating with other developers. I’d like to be able to document my time, what I did, what I learned, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>This shouldn’t be too elaborate, but it’s meant to be much more punctuated:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Today, I worked</li>
  <li>Today, I did XYZ</li>
  <li>Today, I got a little better</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about my work or would like to hire or collaborate with me, feel free to contact me.</p>

<p>To your development and mine,</p>
