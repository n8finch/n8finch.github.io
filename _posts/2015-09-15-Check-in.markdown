##Main GTD for the Day##

- Learn about issues, pull requests, forks, and other collarorative measures on GitHub.

####Did I do this?####

- Yes!

###What Else Did I Accomplish?###

- Got the project scope for the ECCK started
- Identified some weekpoints for the ECCK project
- Worked on the Xavier theme a bit. 

Today was a lot of grunt work leading up to a massive project. There will be more over the next week. Measure twice, cut once, they say.
