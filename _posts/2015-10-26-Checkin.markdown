##Main GTD for the Day##

- Get all the variation WooCommerce

####Did I do this?####

- No, waiting on the final variation.

###What Else Did I Accomplish?###

- Customize PDF, almost finished

###What did I learn or study today?###

- I learned that I can be presented with some html/php code (the PDF code, in this case) and read through it enough to know what's going on.
- I can write out a basic add_action and callback function from memory now. Woohoo!!!
