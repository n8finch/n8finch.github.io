##Main GTD for the Day##

- Test member importing

####Did I do this?####

- Yes, but will need to use a different plugin (maybe WPAllImport User addon)

###What Else Did I Accomplish?###

- Make changes to the website things (colors, RSVP, slide titles)
- Finished setting up pantheon dev flow (.gitignore files as well)
- Variations and products up on WooCommerce
- BitBucket Workflow

###What did I learn or study today?###

- Learned a LOT about the Pantheon environment
- Learned more about workflow today than in a while
- Learned how to set up a repository in BitBucket (nice and private!)
