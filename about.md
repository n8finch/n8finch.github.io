I'm a WordPress developer. 

This is a basic Jekyll blog, but it's not my main blog (or series of blogs).

***So what gives???***

Well, I work on projects daily that do not involve me committing anything, pushing code, or showing any evidence that I "checked in" for the day. 

GitHub offers free web pages for Users and Projects. 

So, I thought I'd take advatage of this to serve **3 main purposes**:

1. **Showing up**.This blog exists to show a history of me "showing up and doing the work". As an independent freelancer, I don't have anyone looking over my shoulder and making sure I'm on task and working for the day, that I did *something*, ***anything*** today. 
2. **Accountability**. GitHub has the "Contributions Calendar", which shows if you were actively pushing code on any given day. I do like to take weekends "off", or at least not work as hard:-). However, having a visual representation of my working time and trying not to "break the chain" is essential for my personal encouragement and continued progress as a developer.
3. **Documentation**. Getting in the habit of documenting the work I do is essential not only for me, but for colaborating with other developers. I'd like to be able to document my time, what I did, what I learned, etc. 

This shouldn't be too elaborate, but it's meant to be much more punctuated:

- Today, I worked
- Today, I did XYZ
- Today, I got a little better
